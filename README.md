📊 Retail Performance Dashboard – Power BI
---
This dashboard provides a comprehensive and dynamic view of retail performance, using a collection of core KPIs that cover revenue, total sales, number of transactions, average sales per transaction, and average transaction value. These indicators collectively offer a clear and immediate understanding of overall business health.
---
The report includes clean and intuitive visualizations, such as time-series charts for revenue by hour and by month. These visuals are enhanced with dynamic variance indicators that highlight performance changes relative to previous periods, making it easy to identify whether the shift represents growth or decline.
---
A key feature of this project is the use of dynamic titles. Each chart automatically displays the top-performing month or hour, the variance in profits, and the percentage change compared to the previous benchmark. This provides a more contextual and narrative-driven analysis experience.
---
To ensure clean, modular, and maintainable DAX logic, the project utilizes User-Defined Functions (UDFs).
These UDFs encapsulate repeated formatting logic — such as number formatting, difference calculations, and growth indicators — into reusable DAX functions. This approach significantly reduces code repetition, enhances readability, and creates a more scalable modeling structure.
---
The dashboard also includes a dynamic pie chart that visualizes revenue distribution across stores, locations, and payment types, enabling quick interpretation of contribution patterns.
---
Additionally, a comparative chart presents total sales and average transaction value by item, complemented by average reference lines to highlight deviations and performance balance.
---
For enhanced interactivity, the dashboard incorporates dynamic filters for years, months, and weekdays, allowing users to explore the data from multiple analytical perspectives.
